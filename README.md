# Medical-Clinic-Page
A Web page of fictional medical clinic
This is the basic version of the website. It plans to increase it`s functionality by, among others, ordering teleconsultations 
and e-prescriptions for medicines.
The clinic is mostly used by elderly people. Therefore, it is aimed at older people. That's why I used large fonts and a visible button.
To increase the readability of the page, I did not use a lot of animations. I haven't given up on them completely because
I want my website to attract younger patients
If after increasing the functionality the page will be overloaded, I will transform it into a multi-page.
This is to reduce the need to scroll because, as I mentioned above, the website is designed for elderly people.
